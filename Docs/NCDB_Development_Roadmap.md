#### 2.3 Add Dependencies (Swift Package Manager)

**Required Packages:**
- [ ] Add FeedKit (for RSS news scraping)
  - Repository: `https://github.com/nmdias/FeedKit`

**Optional Packages:**
- [ ] Kingfisher (image caching) - consider if needed beyond custom solution
- [ ] SwiftUI Introspect (if needed for advanced customization)

#### 2.4 Configure Build Settings

- [ ] Set iOS deployment target to 26.0
- [ ] Enable SwiftUI previews
- [ ] Configure code signing
- [ ] Set up app capabilities:
  - [ ] Background modes (if needed for news updates)
  - [ ] Push notifications (optional)
  - [ ] App Groups (for widget data sharing)

#### 2.5 Working with Claude Code + Xcode AI

**Hybrid Development Approach:**

**Claude Code CLI Usage:**
- Use for complex logic implementation
- Architecture-level decisions
- Batch file generation
- Code review and refactoring

**Xcode AI Coding Assistant Usage:**
- Use for inline code completion
- Quick fixes and suggestions
- UI layout tweaking in real-time
- SwiftUI preview debugging

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. **Plan** with Claude Code: Discuss architecture, generate service layer code
2. **Implement** in Xcode: Copy code, use Xcode AI for refinements
3. **Test** in Xcode: Build, run, iterate with Xcode AI
4. **Review** with Claude Code: Get feedback on implementation
5. **Refine** in Xcode: Apply suggestions, continue with AI assistance

**Tips for Hybrid Mode:**
- Keep Claude Code terminal open in separate window
- Use Claude Code for generating complete files
- Use Xcode AI for completing partial implementations
- Commit frequently to Git so both tools can track changes
- Use Claude Code for explaining complex existing code
